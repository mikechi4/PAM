# PAM
<h3>Overview</h3>
This was my first full-stack application utilizing the SANE (Sql, Angular, Node, Express) stack. This was built using the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>
framework. <br><br>
PAM (Personal Account Manager) is a phone app that allows users to set a monthly budget, and track their expenses during the month. 
Users can add transactions with name, price, date, and category. Upon adding the transactions, there is a dynamic chart that allows users to see
a visual representation of where they are spending their money based on the category it was logged as. The chart utilizes the <a href="http://nvd3.org/examples/">nvD3</a>
library.
